"""
Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that
are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000,
and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number.
And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on
Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
